# Fantasy_Baseball_Draft_Calculator

Hello and welcome!

This is a fun little project I've been working on for my own personal use in my amateur fantasy baseball leagues. 

The program takes an excel file with names of players, positions, and projected points values, and calculated their draft value. For now, this program only works with points league, but I plan to expand to traditional roto leagues as well.
